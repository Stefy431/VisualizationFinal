<h2><center>Methodology of Visualization</center></h2>

<p><center>This is my methodology for my final project.</center></p>

<div>For my final project, i decided to use the database Video Game Sales in order to make my project. This database has a lot of records, over 16,000 records. This database in particular explores video games sales over the past few decades. Since this database explored the many video game sales of different games and platforms, i asked myself a few questions about the database in order to know what visualization to make. 
    <br><br>
    I asked myself the question, what is the most popular video game genre from the years 1984-2020(which is how far the database goes.)
    <br><br>
    One of the first things i wanted to do in order to prepare for the visualization is that i had to decided what exactly to do, specifically with genre of the video games. I thought it would be beneficial to explore what genres of video games were the most popular. So, before getting started with the visualization i knew that i wanted to do a pie chart as my visulaization. I thought it would be interesting to see what were the most popular genres, and what still could be popular as of more recent.
